If you haven't checked the [Tech Stack](./Tech-Stack), please review that before setting up the project. Besides knowing the tech stack, setup is quite straightforward.

## Prerequisites

- Have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed.
- Have [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
- Have [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed.
- Setup a [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project or use an existing one.
  - For Google auth, follow the instructions [here](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth#sign-in-with-google) to setup Google authentication for your Supabase project.
  - You can opt out of Supabase by supplying your own auth flow and database. It will require more domain knowledge for the developer but it is an option if you plan to fork this project.

## Installation

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/armintalaie/Orbit.git
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

In the `application` directory:

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory of the nextjs project and add the following environment variables and replace the values with your own credentials.

```text
NODE_ENV=development # environment
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<supabase_url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<supabase_anon_key>
DB_CONNECTION=<connectionURI> # check your postgres server
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=<public_URL> # used for auth redirects

GOOGE_CLIENT_ID=<google_client_id> # if you use Google Auth
GOOLE_CLIENT_SECRET=<google_client_secret>  # if you use Google Auth

NEXT_PUBLIC_SYNC_URL=ws://localhost:3000 # Optional: used for live-syncing. Referes to the websocket server
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Check your terminal for the localhost URL to open
