### Details

This endpoint is used to update roles across a workspace. Given a unique role name across the workspace, a list of permissions, it will create a new role for
the workspace. Permissions should be from a list of avalailable permissions. See [permissions endpoint](../../resources/permissions).

This endpoint can be accessed only by workspaces users with `workspace:admin` or `workspace:modify` permissions.
exception: default workspace roles, i.e. admin, member, owner cannot be modified.
